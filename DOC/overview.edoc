@title Erl Memcache
@doc This application is able to start/stop memcached instances in the host where it runs and also offer
configurable connection pools to interact with those instances or others that may be running
(locally or remotely).
At the moment, local memcached instances are started and stopped via os commands.
This application uses no configuration.
